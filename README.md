# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a fun game, which instructs you to guess a number between a given range. The computer then generates a random in that specific range. If you guess a number which is lower than the random number, the computer instructs to guess a higher number and vice versa. After several attempts the user finally manages to converge to the actual number.
